  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>The next three chapters are about systems made up of components and connections between components. For example, in a social network, the components are people and connections represent friendships, business relationships, etc. In an ecological food web, the components are species and the connections represent predator-prey relationships.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we introduce NetworkX, a Python package for building models of these systems. We start with the Erd&#x151;s-R&#xE9;nyi model, which has interesting mathematical properties. In the next chapter we move on to models that are more useful for explaining real-world systems.</p>
  <p>The code for this chapter is in <url href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/pearcej/complex-colab/blob/master/teamwork/chap04.ipynb" visual="https://colab.research.google.com/github/pearcej/complex-colab/blob/master/teamwork/chap04.ipynb">chap04.ipynb</url> in the repository for this book. More information about working with the code is in <xref ref="notebooks"/> as well as in the two appendices.</p>

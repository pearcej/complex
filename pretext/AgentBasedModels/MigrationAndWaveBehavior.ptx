  <p>Although the purpose of Sugarscape is not primarily to explore the movement of agents in space, Epstein and Axtell observed some interesting patterns when agents migrate.</p>
  <p>If we start with all agents in the lower-left corner, they quickly move toward the closest <q>peak</q> of high-capacity cells. But if there are more agents than a single peak can support, they quickly exhaust the sugar and agents are forced to move into lower-capacity areas.</p>
  <p>The ones with the longest vision cross the valley between the peaks and propagate toward the northeast in a pattern that resembles a wave front. Because they leave a stripe of empty cells behind them, other agents don't follow until the sugar grows back.</p>
  <p>The result is a series of discrete waves of migration, where each wave resembles a coherent object, like the spaceships we saw in the Rule 110 CA and Game of Life (see <xref ref="cellular-automatons_determinism"/> and <xref ref="game-of-life_life-patterns"/>).</p>
  <p><xref ref="abm-fig-5"/>  shows the initial condition (left) and the state of the model after 6 steps (middle) and 12 steps (right). You can see the first two waves reaching and moving through the second peak, leaving a stripe of empty cells behind. You can see an animated version of this model, where the wave patterns are more clearly visible, in the notebook for this chapter.</p>
  <p>These waves move diagonally, which is surprising because the agents themselves only move north or east, never northeast. Outcomes like this &#x2014; groups or <q>aggregates</q> with properties and behaviors that the agents don't have &#x2014; are common in agent-based models. We will see more examples in the next chapter.</p>

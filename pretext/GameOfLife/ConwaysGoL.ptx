  <title>Conway's GoL</title>
  <p>One of the first cellular automatons to be studied, and probably the most popular of all time, is a 2-D CA called <q>The Game of Life</q>, or GoL for short. It was developed by John H. Conway and popularized in 1970 in Martin Gardner's column in <em>Scientific American</em>.</p>
  <p>The cells in GoL are arranged in a 2-D <term>grid</term>, that is, an array of rows and columns. Usually the grid is considered to be infinite, but in practice it is often <q>wrapped</q>; that is, the right edge is connected to the left, and the top edge to the bottom.</p>
  <p>Each cell in the grid has two states &#x2014; live and dead &#x2014; and 8 neighbors &#x2014; north, south, east, west, and the four diagonals. This set of neighbors is sometimes called a <q>Moore neighborhood</q>.</p>
  <p>Like the 1-D CAs in the previous chapters, GoL evolves over time according to rules, which are like simple laws of physics.</p>
  <p>In GoL, the next state of each cell depends on its current state and its number of live neighbors. If a cell is alive, it stays alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbors, and dies otherwise. If a cell is dead, it stays dead unless it has exactly 3 neighbors.</p>
  <p>This behavior is loosely analogous to real cell growth: cells that are isolated or overcrowded die; at moderate densities they flourish.</p>
  <p>GoL is popular because:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>There are simple initial conditions that yield surprisingly complex behavior.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are many interesting stable patterns: some oscillate (with various periods) and some move like the spaceships in Wolfram's Rule 110 CA.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>And like Rule 110, GoL is Turing complete.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Another factor that generated interest was Conway's conjecture &#x2014; that there is no initial condition that yields unbounded growth in the number of live cells &#x2014; and the $50 bounty he offered to anyone who could prove or disprove it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Finally, the increasing availability of computers made it possible to automate the computation and display the results graphically.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>In this chapter we consider two-dimensional cellular automatons, especially John Conway's Game of Life (GoL). Like some of the 1-D CAs in the previous chapter, GoL follows simple rules and produces surprisingly complicated behavior. And like Wolfram's Rule 110, GoL turns out to be universal; that is, it can compute any computable function, at least in theory.</p>
  <p>Complex behavior in GoL raises issues in the philosophy of science, particularly related to scientific realism and instrumentalism. I discuss these issues and suggest additional reading.</p>
  <p>At the end of the chapter, I demonstrate ways to implement GoL efficiently in Python.</p>
  <p>The code for this chapter is in <url href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/pearcej/complex-colab/blob/master/notebooks/chap08.ipynb" visual="https://colab.research.google.com/github/pearcej/complex-colab/blob/master/notebooks/chap08.ipynb">chap08.ipynb</url> in the repository for this book. More information about working with the code is in <xref ref="preface_notebooks"/>.</p>

  <p><term>Beehive:</term> A stable pattern in which every cell in the beehive has 2 or 3 neighbors, so they all survive, and none of the dead cells adjacent to the beehive has 3 neighbors, so no new cells are born.</p>
  <p><term>Glider:</term> After a period of 4 steps, the glider is back in the starting configuration, shifted one unit down and to the right.</p>
  <p><term>Gosper's Gun:</term> Is a stable pattern that periodically produces a spaceship &#x2014; as the stream of spaceships moves out from the source, the number of live cells grows indefinitely.</p>
  <p><term>Instrumentalism:</term> Instrumentalism is the view that theories are instruments that we use for our purposes.</p>
  <p><term>Methuselahs:</term> Long-lived patterns that yield a surprising number of live cells.</p>
  <p><term>Puffer Train:</term> A translating pattern that leaves live cells in its wake.</p>
  <p><term>Scientific Realism:</term> Scientific realism pertains to scientific theories and the entities they postulate. A theory postulates an entity if it is expressed in terms of the properties and behavior of the entity.</p>
  <p><term>Spaceships:</term> Called this because as some patterns oscillate and return to the starting configuration, but shifted in space.</p>
  <p><term>Stable Pattern:</term> Pattern that does not change from generation to generation.</p>
  <p><term>Toad:</term> They change over time but eventually return to their starting configuration, which is an oscillator that alternates between two states. The <q>period</q> of this oscillator is 2.</p>
  <p><term>Unstable Pattern:</term> Pattern that changes from generation to generation.</p>

  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>The cellular automatons we have seen so far are not physical models; that is, they are not intended to describe systems in the real world. But some CAs are intended as physical models.</p>
  <p>In this chapter we consider a CA that models chemicals that diffuse (spread out) and react with each other, which is a process Alan Turing proposed to explain how some animal patterns develop.</p>
  <p>And we'll experiment with a CA that models percolation of liquid through porous material, like water through coffee grounds. This model is the first of several models that exhibit <term>phase change</term> behavior and <term>fractal geometry</term>, and we will explain what both of those mean.</p>

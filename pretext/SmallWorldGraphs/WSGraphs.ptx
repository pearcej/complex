  <p>To make a <term>Watts-Strogatz</term> (<term>WS</term>) <term>graph</term>, we start with a ring lattice and <q>rewire</q> some of the edges. In their paper, Watts and Strogatz consider the edges in a particular order and rewire each one with probability <math>p</math>. If an edge is rewired, they leave the first node unchanged and choose the second node at random. They don't allow self loops or multiple edges; that is, you can't have a edge from a node to itself, and you can't have more than one edge between the same two nodes.</p>
  <p>Here is an implementation of this process.</p>
  <pre>def rewire(G, p):
nodes = set(G)
for u, v in G.edges():
    if flip(p):
        choices = nodes - {u} - set(G[u])
        new_v = np.random.choice(list(choices))
        G.remove_edge(u, v)
        G.add_edge(u, new_v)</pre>
  <p>The parameter <c>p</c> is the probability of rewiring an edge. The for loop enumerates the edges and uses <c>flip</c> (defined below) to choose which ones get rewired.</p>
  <pre>def flip(p):
    return np.random.random() &lt; p</pre>
  <p><c>flip</c> uses a module from NumPy (which is imported as np in this example) named <c>random</c>. This module has a method also named <c>random</c>, which returns a number between 0 and 1.</p>
  <p><c>flip</c> returns <c>True</c> when the random number is less than the given probability <c>p</c>, it returns false when the random number is greater than or equal to <c>p</c>.</p>
  <p>If we are rewiring an edge from node <c>u</c> to node <c>v</c>, we have to choose a replacement for <c>v</c>, called <c>new_v</c>.</p>
  <p>
    <ol label="1">
      <li>
        <p>To compute the possible choices, we start with <c>nodes</c>, which is a set, and subtract off u and its neighbors, which avoids self loops and multiple edges.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To choose <c>new_v</c>, we use the NumPy function <c>choice</c>, which is in the module random.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Then we remove the existing edge from <c>u</c> to <c>v</c>, and</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add a new edge from <c>u</c> to <c>new_v</c>.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>As an aside, the expression <c>G[u]</c> returns a dictionary that contains the neighbors of <c>u</c> as keys. It is usually faster than using <c>G.neighbors</c>.</p>
  <p>This function does not consider the edges in the order specified by Watts and Strogatz, but that doesn't seem to affect the results.</p>
  <p><xref ref="id1-14"/> shows WS graphs with <math>n=20</math>, <math>k=4</math>, and a range of values of p. When <math>p=0</math>, the graph is a ring lattice. When <math>p=1</math>, it is completely random. As we'll see, the interesting things happen in between.</p>

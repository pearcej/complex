  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Many networks in the real world, including social networks, have the <q>small world property</q>, which is that the average distance between nodes, measured in number of edges on the shortest path, is much smaller than expected.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we explore Stanley Milgram's famous Small World Experiment, which was the first demonstration of the small world property in a real social network. Then we'll consider Watts-Strogatz graphs, which are intended as a model of small world graphs. We will replicate the experiment Watts and Strogatz performed and explain what it is intended to show.</p>
  <p>Along the way, we'll see two new graph algorithms: breadth-first search (BFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the shortest path between nodes in a graph.</p>

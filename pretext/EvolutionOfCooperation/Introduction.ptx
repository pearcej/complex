  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>In this final chapter, we engage with two questions, one from biology and one from philosophy:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In biology, the <q><term>problem of altruism</term></q> is the apparent conflict between natural selection, which suggests that animals live in a state of constant competition, and <term>altruism</term>, which is the tendency of many animals to help other animals, even to their own detriment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In moral philosophy, the question of human nature asks whether humans are fundamentally good, or evil, or blank states shaped by their environment.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The tools we will use to address these questions are agent-based simulation (again) and game theory, which is a set of abstract models meant to describe ways agents interact. Specifically, the game we will consider is the Prisoner's Dilemma.</p>

  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>In the previous chapter we saw an example of a system with a critical point and we explored one of the common properties of critical systems, fractal geometry.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we explore two other properties of critical systems: heavy-tailed distributions, which we saw in <xref ref="scale-free-networks_heavy-tailed-distributions"/> and pink noise, which We'll see in this chapter.</p>
  <p>These properties are interesting in part because they appear frequently in nature; that is, many natural systems produce fractal-like geometry, heavy-tailed distributions, and pink noise.</p>
  <p>This observation raises a natural question: why do so many natural systems have properties of critical systems? A possible answer is <term>self-organized criticality</term> (SOC), which is the tendency of some systems to evolve toward, and stay in, a critical state.</p>
  <p>In this chapter We will explore a <term>sand pile model</term> that was the first system shown to exhibit SOC.</p>

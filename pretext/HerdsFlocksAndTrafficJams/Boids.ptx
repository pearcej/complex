  <title>Boids</title>
  <p>In 1987 Craig Reynolds published <q>Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model</q>, which describes an agent-based model of herd behavior.</p>
  <p>Agents in this model are called <q>Boids</q>, which is both a contraction of <q>bird-oid</q> and an accented pronunciation of <q>bird</q> (although Boids are also used to model fish and herding land animals).</p>
  <p>Each agent simulates three behaviors:</p>
  <p><term>Flock centering:</term>  Move toward the center of the flock.</p>
  <p><term>Collision avoidance:</term>  Avoid obstacles, including other Boids.</p>
  <p><term>Velocity matching:</term>  Align velocity (speed and direction) with neighboring Boids.</p>
  <p>Boids make decisions based on local information only; each Boid only sees (or pays attention to) other Boids in its field of vision.</p>
  <p>In the repository for this book, you will find <c>Boids7.py</c>, which contains an implementation of Boids, based in part on the description in Gary William Flake's book, <em>The Computational Beauty of Nature.</em></p>
  <p>The given implementation uses VPython, which is a library that provides 3-D graphics. VPython provides a vector object, which can be used to represent the position and velocity of Boids in three dimensions.</p>

          <p>Sorry but Boids only make decisions based on local information because they only pay attention to local Boids.</p>

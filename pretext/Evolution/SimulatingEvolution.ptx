  <title>Simulating Evolution</title>
  <p>We start with a simple model that demonstrates a basic form of evolution. According to the theory, the following features are sufficient to produce evolution:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>Replicators</term>: We need a population of agents that can reproduce in some way. We'll start with replicators that make perfect copies of themselves. Later we'll add imperfect copying, that is, mutation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Variation</term>: We need variability in the population, that is, differences between individuals.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Differential survival</term> or <term>reproduction</term>: The differences between individuals have to affect their ability to survive or reproduce.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>To simulate these features, we'll define a population of agents that represent individual organisms. Each agent has genetic information, called its <term>genotype</term>, which is the information that gets copied when the agent replicates. In our model, a genotype is represented by a sequence of <c>N</c> binary digits (zeros and ones), where <c>N</c> is a parameter we choose.</p>
  <p>To generate variation, we create a population with a variety of genotypes; later we will explore mechanisms that create or increase variation.</p>
  <p>Finally, to generate differential survival and reproduction, we define a function that maps from each genotype to a <term>fitness</term>, where fitness is a quantity related to the ability of an agent to survive or reproduce.</p>

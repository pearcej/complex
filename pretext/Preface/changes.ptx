  <title>Changes from the Second Edition of <em>Think Complexity</em></title>
  <p>by Jan Pearce</p>
  <p>I have been teaching from Allen Downey's excellent
            <url href="http://greenteapress.com/complexity/" visual="http://greenteapress.com/complexity/">Think Complexity</url>
            for a number of years now. I was motivated to create a Runestone edition of this book,
            so it could be interactive. I also plan to add some additional material on computational complexity in addition to the material on complexity science.</p>
  <p>Thus far, I have added a chapter on algorithm analysis based on a chapter in
            <url href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/cppds/index.html" visual="https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/cppds/index.html">Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using C++</url>
            by Brad Miller, David Ranum, and Jan Pearce. To facilitate online work,
            the possibility of using Google Colaboratory notebooks has been added in
            addition to the original Jupyter Noteooks written by Allen Downey.</p>
  <p>In future editions, I plan to add more material on the traveling salesman problem and
            the use of heuristics as well as complexity classes as well as the important P vs NP problem.</p>

  <p>How many of these CAs are there?</p>
  <p>Since each cell is either on or off, we can specify the state of a cell with a single bit. In a neighborhood with three cells, there are 8 possible configurations, so there are 8 entries in the rule tables. And since each entry contains a single bit, we can specify a table using 8 bits. With 8 bits, we can specify 256 different rules.</p>
  <p>One of Wolfram's first experiments with CAs was to test all 256 possibilities and classify them.</p>
  <p>Examining the results visually, he proposed that the behavior of CAs can be grouped into four classes. Class 1 contains the simplest (and least interesting) CAs, the ones that evolve from almost any starting condition to the same uniform pattern. As a trivial example, Rule 0 always generates an empty pattern after one time step.</p>
  <p>Rule 50 is an example of Class 2. It generates a simple pattern with nested structure, that is, a pattern that contains many smaller versions of itself. Rule 18 makes the nested structure even clearer; <xref ref="ca-fig-2"/> shows what it looks like after 64 steps.</p>
  <p>Some Class 2 CAs generate patterns that are intricate and pretty, but compared to Classes 3 and 4, they are relatively simple.</p>

Installing Jupyter
--------------------
Installation instructions
To prepare for this tutorial, you will need to:

- Install Jupyter on your laptop and download my code from Git https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkComplexity2.git.

We will be using the Anaconda distribution of Python in this class. It is a very complete installation of Python, and nearly all of the packages you will need for many years of data science productivity are included in the initial installation.

The good people who created Anaconda have also provided a very nice set of instructors to help you install it for the first time. There are instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The installation guide is also part of a larger set of documentation that you may find useful. Make sure you follow the instructions for a Regular Installation of Anaconda, and that you install the Python 3.x version (3.7 at the time of this writing). Do not install miniconda or do a silent installation.

Implementing CAs
----------------

To generate the figures in this chapter, I wrote a Python class called ``Cell1D`` that represents a 1-D cellular automaton, and a class called ``Cell1DViewer`` that plots the results. Both are defined in ``Cell1D.py`` in the repository for this book.

To store the state of the CA, I use a NumPy array with one column for each cell and one row for each time step.

To explain how my implementation works, I’ll start with a CA that computes the parity of the cells in each neighborhood. The “parity” of a number is 0 if the number is even and 1 if it is odd.

I use the NumPy function ``zeros`` to create an array of zeros, then put a 1 in the middle of the first row.

::

    rows = 5
    cols = 11
    array = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=np.uint8)
    array[0, 5] = 1
    print(array)

    [[ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
    [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
    [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
    [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
    [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]]

The data type ``uint8`` indicates that the elements of ``array`` are unsigned 8-bit integers.

``plot_ca`` displays the elements of an ``array`` graphically:

::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    def plot_ca(array, rows, cols):
        cmap = plt.get_cmap('Blues')
        plt.imshow(array, cmap=cmap, interpolation='none')

I import ``pyplot`` with the abbreviated name ``plt``, which is conventional. The function ``get_cmap`` returns a colormap, which maps from the values in the array to colors. The colormap ``'Blues'`` draws the “on" cells in dark blue and the “off" cells in light blue.

``imshow`` displays the array as an “image”; that is, it draws a colored square for each element of the array. Setting ``interpolation`` to ``none`` indicates that ``imshow`` should not interpolate between on and off cells.

To compute the state of the CA during time step i, we have to add up consecutive elements of array and compute the parity of the sum. We can do that using a slice operator to select the elements and the modulus operator to compute parity:

:: 

    
    def step(array, i):
        rows, cols = array.shape
        row = array[i-1]
        for j in range(1, cols):
            elts = row[j-1:j+2]
            array[i, j] = sum(elts) % 2

``rows`` and ``cols`` are the dimensions of the array. ``row`` is the previous row of the array.

Each time through the loop, we select three elements from ``row``, add them up, compute the parity, and store the result in row ``i``.

In this example, the lattice is finite, so the first and last cells have only one neighbor. To handle this special case, I don’t update the first and last column; they are always 0.

.. dragndrop:: matching_9
    :match_1: Avalanche|||When a single grain causes the cells to topple which then affects a substantial friction of the grid.
    :match_2: Box-Counting|||A way of determining the fractal dimension of a set S in a Euclidean space Rn.
    :match_3: Fractal geometry|||Patterns have self-similarity, they are similar when compared  to the copies of the whole.
    :match_4: Holistic Model|||This model focuses more on similarities between systems and less interest in analogous parts. 
    :match_5: Noise|||It is a signal which contains many frequency components in the context of signal processing
    :match_6: Pink Noise|||In this, low-frequency components have more power than high-frequency components.
    :match_7: Power Spectrum|||A function that shows the power of each frequency component.
    :match_8: Proximate Cause|||The cause that is most immediately responsible for a large avalanche. 
    :match_9: Reductionist Model|||Describing a system by describing their interactions and parts. 
    :match_10: Sand Pile Model|||A 2-D cellular automaton where the state of each cell represents the slope of part of a sand pile.
    :match_11: Self-Organized Critically (SOC)|||The tendency of some systems to evolve toward, and stay in, a critical state.
    :match_12: Signal|||Any quantity that varies in time.
    :match_13: Ultimate Cause|||A deeper kind of explanation for a large avalanche.

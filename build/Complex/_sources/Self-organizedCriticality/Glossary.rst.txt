**Avalanche:** When a single grain causes the cells to topple which then affects a substantial friction of the grid.

**Holistic Model:** Holistic models are more focused on similarities between systems and less interested in analogous parts. A holistic approach to modeling consists of these steps:
    
Observe a behavior that appears in a variety of systems.
    
Find a simple model that demonstrates that behavior.
    
Identify the elements of the model that are necessary and sufficient to produce the behavior.

**Noise:** In common use, noise is usually an unwanted sound, but in the context of signal processing, it is a signal that contains many frequency components.

**Pink Noise:** Complex signals can be decomposed into their frequency components. In pink noise, low-frequency components have more power than high-frequency components. Specifically, the power at frequency :math:`f` is proportional to :math:`1/f`.

**Power Spectrum:** The power spectrum of a signal is a function that shows the power of each frequency component.

**Proximate Cause:** It is the cause most immediately responsible for a large avalanche.

**Reductionist Model:** A reductionist model describes a system by describing its parts and their interactions.

**Sand Pile Model:** Proposed by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld in 1987. The sand pile model is a 2-D cellular automaton where the state of each cell represents the slope of a part of a sand pile.

**Self-Organized Critically (SOC):** It is the tendency of some systems to evolve toward, and stay in, a critical state.

**Signal:** A signal is any quantity that varies in time. One example is sound, which is variation in air density. In the sand pile model, the signals weâ€™ll consider are avalanche durations and sizes as they vary over time.

**Ultimate Cause:** It is the cause that is considered some deeper kind of explanation for a large avalanche.

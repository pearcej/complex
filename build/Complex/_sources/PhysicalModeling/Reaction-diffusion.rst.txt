Reaction-Diffusion
------------------
Now let’s add a second chemical. I’ll define a new object, ``ReactionDiffusion``, that contains two arrays, one for each chemical:

::

    class ReactionDiffusion(Cell2D):

   def __init__(self, n, m, params, noise=0.1):
        self.params = params
        self.array = np.ones((n, m), dtype=float)
        self.array2 = noise * np.random.random((n, m))
        add_island(self.array2)

``n`` and ``m`` are the number of rows and columns in the array. ``params`` is a tuple of parameters, which I explain below.

``array`` represents the concentration of the first chemical, ``A``; the NumPy function ``ones`` initializes it to 1 everywhere. The data type ``float`` indicates that the elements of ``A`` are floating-point values.

``array2`` represents the concentration of ``B``, which is initialized with random values between 0 and ``noise``, which is 0.1 by default. Then ``add_island`` adds an island of higher concentration in the middle:

::

    def add_island(a, height=0.1):
        n, m = a.shape
        radius = min(n, m) // 20
        i = n//2
        j = m//2
        a[i-radius:i+radius, j-radius:j+radius] += height

The radius of the island is one twentieth of ``n`` or ``m``, whichever is smaller. The height of the island is ``height``, with the default value 0.1.

Here is the ``step`` function that updates the arrays:

::

    def step(self):
        A = self.array
        B = self.array2
        ra, rb, f, k = self.params

        cA = correlate2d(A, self.kernel, **self.options)
        cB = correlate2d(B, self.kernel, **self.options)

        reaction = A * B**2
        self.array += ra * cA - reaction + f * (1-A)
        self.array2 += rb * cB + reaction - (f+k) * B

The parameters are:

**ra**:
The diffusion rate of ``A`` (analogous to ``r`` in the previous section).

**rb**:
The diffusion rate of ``B``. In most versions of this model, ``rb`` is about half of ra.

**f**:
The “feed” rate, which controls how quickly ``A`` is added to the system

**k**:
The “kill” rate, which controls how quickly ``B`` is removed from the system.

Now let’s look more closely at the update statements:

::

    reaction = A * B**2
    self.array += ra * cA - reaction + f * (1-A)
    self.array2 += rb * cB + reaction - (f+k) * B

.. _fig_reac-dif:

The arrays ``cA`` and ``cB`` are the result of applying a diffusion kernel to ``A`` and ``B``. Multiplying by ``ra`` and ``rb`` yields the rate of diffusion into or out of each cell.

The term ``A * B**2`` represents the rate that ``A`` and ``B`` react with each other. Assuming that the reaction consumes ``A`` and produces ``B``, we subtract this term in the first equation and add it in the second.

The term ``f * (1-A)`` determines the rate that ``A`` is added to the system. Where ``A`` is near 0, the maximum feed rate is ``f``. Where ``A`` approaches 1, the feed rate drops off to 0.

Finally, the term ``(f+k) * B`` determines the rate that ``B`` is removed from the system. As ``B`` approaches 0, this rate goes to 0.

As long as the rate parameters are not too high, the values of ``A`` and ``B`` usually stay between 0 and 1.

With different parameters, this model can produce patterns similar to the stripes and spots on a variety of animals. In some cases, the similarity is striking, especially when the feed and kill parameters vary in space.

For all simulations in this section, ``ra=0.5`` and ``rb=0.25``.

:ref:`Figure 8.2 <fig_reac-dif>` shows results with ``f=0.035`` and ``k=0.057``, with the concentration of ``B`` shown in darker colors. With these parameters, the system evolves toward a stable configuration with light spots of ``A`` on a dark background of ``B``.

:ref:`Figure 8.3 <fig-8.3>` shows results with ``f=0.055`` and ``k=0.062``, which yields a coral-like pattern of ``B`` on a background of ``A``.

    Figure 8.4: A reaction-diffusion model with parameters f=0.039 and k=0.065 after 1000, 2000, and 4000 steps.

:ref:`Figure 8.4 <fig-8.4>` shows results with ``f=0.039`` and ``k=0.065``. These parameters produce spots of ``B`` that grow and divide in a process that resembles mitosis, ending with a stable pattern of equally-spaced spots.

Since 1952, observations and experiments have provided some support for Turing’s conjecture. At this point it seems likely, but not yet proven, that many animal patterns are actually formed by reaction-diffusion processes of some kind.

.. mchoice:: q_8.3
   :answer_a: None of the below will yield a coral-like pattern
   :answer_b: f=0.035 and k=0.057 
   :answer_c: f=0.039 and k=0.065 
   :answer_d: f=0.055 and k=0.062
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Sorry but one of the options below does produce a coral-like pattern.
   :feedback_b: Sorry but these parameters make the system evolve in a stable configuration with light spots.
   :feedback_c: Sorry but these parameters produce spots that grow and divide in a process resembling mitosis. 
   :feedback_d: Correct! These parameters yield a coral-like pattern.

   At what point did there appear to be a coral-like pattern?

.. mchoice:: q_8.3.2
   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: False
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct! When f=0.039 and k=0.065 the pattern that is produced looks like the patterns on animals. Though, this has not yet been proven.  
   :feedback_b: Incorrect, please refer back to section.

   Based on the patterns from the text, is there a possibility for animal patterns to be based on diffusion reactions? 

 
.. mchoice:: q_8.3.3
   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: False
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct. A*B**2 does set the rate of reaction.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. Please try again.

   In the above code A*B**2 sets the rate of reaction.

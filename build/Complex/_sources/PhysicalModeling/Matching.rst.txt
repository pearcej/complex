    :match_3: Fractal Geometry|||Patterns formed by fractals.
    :match_4: Percolation|||A process in which a fluid flows through a semi-porous material.
    :match_5: Phase Change|||Rapid change in the behavior near the critical value.
    :match_6: Random Walk|||It is a process that consists of a series of changes that have random characteristics.
    :match_7: Diffusion|||The combining of substances by the natural movement of their particles.
    :match_8: Percolation Model|||A model used to represent percolation that can be abstracted to be use for epidemic modeling, networks of electrical resistors, and other systems that are not directly percolation.

Introduction
------------
The cellular automatons we have seen so far are not physical models; that is, they are not intended to describe systems in the real world. But some CAs are intended as physical models.

In this chapter we consider a CA that models chemicals that diffuse (spread out) and react with each other, which is a process Alan Turing proposed to explain how some animal patterns develop.

And we’ll experiment with a CA that models percolation of liquid through porous material, like water through coffee grounds. This model is the first of several models that exhibit **phase change** behavior and **fractal geometry**, and I’ll explain what both of those mean.

The code for this chapter is in ``chap07.ipynb`` in the repository for this book. More information about working with the code is in :ref:`Section 1.4 <1.4>`.

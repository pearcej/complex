   :match_1: Complexity Science|||Concerned With dynamic, unpredictable, and multi-dimensional complex systems consisting of a collection of interconnected relationships and parts characterized by its non-linearity.
   :match_2: Spontaneous Synchronization|||The effect wherein a population of oscillating units with diverse natural frequencies and weak interactions with one another evolves to spontaneously exhibit collective oscillations at a common frequency.
   :match_3: Agent-Base Models|||It is a model used for simulating actions and interactions between autonomous agents to assess their effects on the system as a whole.
   :match_4: Pseudoscience|||Claims that are presented as scientific and factual but are incompatible with the scientific method.
   :match_5: Classical Models|||Law-based models proven by mathematical derivation.
   :match_6: Determinism|||According to this view, all events are inevitable and are caused by prior events.
   :match_7: Stochastic|||It may be analyzed statistically but may not be predicted precisely due to a random pattern or probability distribution.

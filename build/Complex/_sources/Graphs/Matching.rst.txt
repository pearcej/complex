.. dragndrop:: matching_1
   :match_1: Graph|||A representation of a system that contains discrete and interconnected elements. 
   :match_2: Nodes(Vertices)|||It represents the information that is contained in a single ADT.
   :match_3: Edges|||Enables the connection between nodes and networks.
   :match_4: Directed graph|||Sets of nodes where all edges are directed from one vertex to another.
   :match_5: Undirected graph|||Set of nodes where all edges are bidirectional.
   :match_6: Graph theory|||This models pairwise relations between objects from a certain collection using a mathematical structure.
   :match_7: Graph algorithm|||This algorithm takes as an input one or more graphs.
   :match_8: Path|||A sequence of nodes with an edge between each consecutive pair. 
   :match_9: NetworkX|||A python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. 
   :match_10: Random graph|||In this graph, nodes and edges are generated randomly.
   :match_11: Complete graph|||In this graph, every node is connected to every other node.
   :match_12: Connected graphs|||In this graph, there is a path from every node to every other node.
   :match_13: Stack|||Elements are added and removed from the top.
   :match_14: ER graphs|||In these graphs, a random graph is generated using two closely related models.
   :match_15: Undirected Edge|||Comparable to a two way street, this edge is not constrained to a single direction and is symmetrical to each node it is connected to. 
   :match_16: Directed Edge|||Comparable to a one way street, this edge is constrained to a single direction and is asymmetrical to each node it is connected to.

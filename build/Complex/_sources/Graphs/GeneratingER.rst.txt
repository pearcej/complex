   Figure 3.4: An ER graph with n=10 and p=0.3.

The ER graph :math:`G(n, p)` contains :math:`n` nodes, and each pair of nodes is connected by an edge with probability :math:`p`. Generating an ER graph is similar to generating a complete graph.


The following generator function enumerates all possible edges and chooses which ones should be added to the graph:

::

    def random_pairs(nodes, p):
    for edge in all_pairs(nodes):
        if flip(p):
            yield edge

``random_pairs`` uses ``flip``:

::

    def flip(p):
    return np.random.random() < p

This is the first example we’re seen that uses NumPy. Following convention, I import ``numpy`` as ``np``. NumPy provides a module named ``random``, which provides a method named ``random``, which returns a number between 0 and 1, uniformly distributed.

So ``flip`` returns ``True`` with the given probability, ``p``, and ``False`` with the complementary probability, ``1-p``.

Finally, ``make_random_graph`` generates and returns the ER graph :math:`G(n, p)`:

::

    def make_random_graph(n, p):
    G = nx.Graph()
    nodes = range(n)
    G.add_nodes_from(nodes)
    G.add_edges_from(random_pairs(nodes, p))
    return G

``make_random_graph`` is almost identical to ``make_complete_graph``; the only difference is that it uses ``random_pairs`` instead of ``all_pairs``.

Here’s an example with :math:`p=0.3`:

::

    random_graph = make_random_graph(10, 0.3)

:ref:`Figure 3.4 <3.7>` shows the result. This graph turns out to be connected; in fact, most ER graphs with :math:`n=10` and :math:`p=0.3` are connected. In the next section, we’ll see how many.

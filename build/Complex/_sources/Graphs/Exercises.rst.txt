The code for this chapter is in chap02.ipynb, which is a Jupyter notebook in the repository for this book. For more information about working with this code, see :ref:`Section 1.4 <1.4>`.

**Exercise 1:**   Launch chap02.ipynb and run the code. There are a few short exercises embedded in the notebook that you might want to try.

**Exercise 2:**   In :ref:`Section 3.9 <3.9>` we analyzed the performance of reachable_nodes and classified it in :math:`O(n + m)`, where n is the number of nodes and :math:`m` is the number of edges. Continuing the analysis, what is the order of growth for ``is_connected``?

::

    def is_connected(G):
        start = list(G)[0]
        reachable = reachable_nodes(G, start)
        return len(reachable) == len(G)

**Exercise 3:**   In my implementation of ``reachable_nodes``, you might be bothered by the apparent inefficiency of adding all neighbors to the stack without checking whether they are already in ``seen``. Write a version of this function that checks the neighbors before adding them to the stack. Does this “optimization” change the order of growth? Does it make the function faster?

**Exercise 4:**  
There are actually two kinds of ER graphs. The one we generated in this chapter, :math:`G(n, p)`, is characterized by two parameters, the number of nodes and the probability of an edge between nodes.

An alternative definition, denoted :math:`G(n, m)`, is also characterized by two parameters: the number of nodes, :math:`n`, and the number of edges, :math:`m`. Under this definition, the number of edges is fixed, but their location is random.

Repeat the experiments we did in this chapter using this alternative definition. Here are a few suggestions for how to proceed:

1. Write a function called ``m_pairs`` that takes a list of nodes and the number of edges, :math:`m`, and returns a random selection of :math:`m` edges. A simple way to do that is to generate a list of all possible edges and use random.sample.

2. Write a function called ``make_m_graph`` that takes :math:`n` and :math:`m` and returns a random graph with :math:`n` nodes and :math:`m` edges.

3. Make a version of ``prob_connected`` that uses ``make_m_graph`` instead of ``make_random_graph``.

4. Compute the probability of connectivity for a range of values of :math:`m`.

How do the results of this experiment compare to the results using the first type of ER graph?

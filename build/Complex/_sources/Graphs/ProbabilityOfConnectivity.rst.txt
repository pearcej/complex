   Figure 3.6: Probability of connectivity for several values of n and a range of p.


For given values of :math:`n` and :math:`p`, we would like to know the probability that :math:`G(n, p)` is connected. We can estimate it by generating a large number of random graphs and counting how many are connected. Here’s how:

::

    def prob_connected(n, p, iters=100):
    tf = [is_connected(make_random_graph(n, p))
          for i in range(iters)]
    return np.mean(bool)

The parameters ``n`` and ``p`` are passed along to ``make_random_graph``; ``iters`` is the number of random graphs we generate.

This function uses a list comprehension; if you are not familiar with this feature, you can read about it at http://thinkcomplex.com/comp.

The result, ``tf``, is a list of boolean values: ``True`` for each graph that’s connected and ``False`` for each one that’s not.

``np.mean`` is a NumPy function that computes the mean of this list, treating ``True`` as 1 and ``False`` as 0. The result is the fraction of random graphs that are connected.

::

    >>> prob_connected(10, 0.23, iters=10000)
    0.33

I chose 0.23 because it is close to the critical value where the probability of connectivity goes from near 0 to near 1. According to Erdős and Rényi, :math:`p* = lnn / n = 0.23`.

We can get a clearer view of the transition by estimating the probability of connectivity for a range of values of :math:`p`:

::

    n = 10
    ps = np.logspace(-2.5, 0, 11)
    ys = [prob_connected(n, p) for p in ps]

The NumPy function ``logspace`` returns an array of 11 values from :math:`10^{−2.5}` to :math:`10^0 = 1`, equally spaced on a logarithmic scale.


For each value of ``p`` in the array, we compute the probability that a graph with parameter ``p`` is connected and store the results in ``ys``.

:ref:`Figure 3.5 <fig_3.5>` shows the results, with a vertical line at the computed critical value, :math:`p* = 0.23`. As expected, the transition from 0 to 1 occurs near the critical value.

:ref:`Figure 3.6 <fig_3.6>` shows similar results for larger values of ``n``. As ``n`` increases, the critical value gets smaller and the transition gets more abrupt.

These experimental results are consistent with the analytic results Erdős and Rényi presented in their papers.

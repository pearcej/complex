**Adaptation:** Species interact with their environments in ways that seem too complex, too intricate, and too clever to happen by chance.

**Differential Survival (Reproduction):** The differences between individuals have to affect their ability to survive or reproduce.

**Environment:** The surroundings or conditions in which a person, animal, or plant lives or operates.

**Fitness:** Fitness is a quantity related to the ability of an agent to survive or reproduce.

**Fitness Contributions:** The genotype of an agent, which corresponds to its location in the fitness landscape, is represented by a NumPy array of zeros and ones.

**Fitness Landscape:** The function that maps from genotype to fitness.

**Genotype:** The information that gets copied when the agent replicates.

**Increasing Complexity:** The history of life on earth starts with relatively simple life forms, with more complex organisms appearing later in the geological record.

**Increasing Diversity:** Over time the number of species on earth has generally increased (despite several periods of mass extinction).

**Natural Selection:** The process in which inherited variations between individuals cause differences in survival and reproduction.

**Phenotype:** The fitness landscape represents information about how the genotype of an organism is related to its physical form and capabilities.

**Replicators:** We need a population of agents that can reproduce in some way. We’ll start with replicators that make perfect copies of themselves. Later we’ll add imperfect copying, that is, mutation.

**Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection:** Claims that new species are created and existing species change due to natural selection.

**Variation:** We need variability in the population, that is, differences between individuals.

   Figure 4.2: WS graphs with :math:`n=20`, :math:`k=4`, and :math:`p=0` (left), :math:`p=0.2` (middle), and :math:`p=1` (right).


To make a **Watts-Strogatz** (**WS**) **graph**, we start with a ring lattice and “rewire” some of the edges. In their paper, Watts and Strogatz consider the edges in a particular order and rewire each one with probability :math:`p`. If an edge is rewired, they leave the first node unchanged and choose the second node at random. They don’t allow self loops or multiple edges; that is, you can’t have a edge from a node to itself, and you can’t have more than one edge between the same two nodes.

Here is my implementation of this process.

::

    def rewire(G, p):
    nodes = set(G)
    for u, v in G.edges():
        if flip(p):
            choices = nodes - {u} - set(G[u])
            new_v = np.random.choice(list(choices))
            G.remove_edge(u, v)
            G.add_edge(u, new_v)

The parameter ``p`` is the probability of rewiring an edge. The for loop enumerates the edges and uses ``flip`` (defined in :ref:`Section 3.7 <3.7>`) to choose which ones get rewired.

If we are rewiring an edge from node ``u`` to node ``v``, we have to choose a replacement for ``v``, called ``new_v``.

1. To compute the possible choices, we start with ``nodes``, which is a set, and subtract off u and its neighbors, which avoids self loops and multiple edges.
2. To choose ``new_v``, we use the NumPy function ``choice``, which is in the module random.
3. Then we remove the existing edge from ``u`` to ``v``, and
4. Add a new edge from ``u`` to ``new_v``.

As an aside, the expression ``G[u]`` returns a dictionary that contains the neighbors of ``u`` as keys. It is usually faster than using ``G.neighbors`` (see http://thinkcomplex.com/neigh).

This function does not consider the edges in the order specified by Watts and Strogatz, but that doesn’t seem to affect the results.

:ref:`Figure 4.2 <fig_4.2>` shows WS graphs with :math:`n=20`,:math:`k=4`, and a range of values of p. When :math:`p=0`, the graph is a ring lattice. When :math:`p=1`, it is completely random. As we’ll see, the interesting things happen in between.

.. mchoice:: question_4.5.1
   :answer_a: The graph becomes more random
   :answer_b: The graph becomes more consistent
   :answer_c: No rewiring happens
   :answer_d: The graph becomes more like a lattice
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct!
   :feedback_b: Look again of what happens as p goes higher
   :feedback_c: p is the probability that something is rewired
   :feedback_d: Look again at the picture on the right where p is at its highest

   As demonstrated in figure 4.2, what happens as p increases?

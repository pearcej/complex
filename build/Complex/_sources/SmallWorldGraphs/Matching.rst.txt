   :match_1: Watts-Strogatz Graphs|||It is a model that produces graphs with small-world properties.
   :match_2: Regular Graphs|||This graph has the same number of neighbors.
   :match_3: Clustering|||Measure of cliquishness of the graph.A
   :match_4: Path Length|||Measure of the average distance between two nodes.
   :match_5: Clique|||A set of nodes that are completely connected.
   :match_6: Generative Model|||Modeling the process that builds or leads to the phenomenon to try and explain a phenomenon.
   :match_7: Degree|||The number of neighbors.
   :match_8: Clustering Coefficient|||The measure of the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together in a graph.
   :match_9: Dijkstra's Slgorithm|||In this algorithm we find the minimum distance from a given node to every other node in the graph.
   :match_10: Queue|||Elements are removed in the same order they were entered. 
   :match_11: Breadth-First Search|||Starting from the root node this algorithm explore all of the neighbor nodes at the current level before moving on to the nodes at the next level. 
   :match_12: Depth-First Search|||Starting from the root node this algorithm will explore all the way down a branch and then backtrack. 
   :match_13: Ring Lattice|||A type of regualr graph that Watts and Strogatz used as the basis of their model.

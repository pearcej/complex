Who is this book for?
---------------------

The examples and supporting code for this book are in Python. You should know core Python and be familiar with its object-oriented features, specifically using and defining classes.

If you are not already familiar with Python, you might want to start with *Think Python*, which is appropriate for people who have never programmed before. If you have programming experience in another language, there are many good Python books to choose from, as well as online resources.

I use NumPy, SciPy, and NetworkX throughout the book. If you are familiar with these libraries already, that’s great, but I will also explain them when they appear.

I assume that the reader knows some mathematics: I use logarithms in several places, and vectors in one example. But that’s about it.

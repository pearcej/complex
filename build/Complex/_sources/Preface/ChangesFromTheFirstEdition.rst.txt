Changes from the first edition
-------------------------------

For the second edition, I added two chapters, one on evolution, the other on the evolution of cooperation.

In the first edition, each chapter presented background on a topic and suggested experiments the reader could run. For the second edition, I have done those experiments. Each chapter presents the implementation and results as a worked example, then suggests additional experiments for the reader.

For the second edition, I replaced some of my own code with standard libraries like NumPy and NetworkX. The result is more concise and more efficient, and it gives readers a chance to learn these libraries.

Also, the Jupyter notebooks are new. For every chapter there are two notebooks: one contains the code from the chapter, explanatory text, and exercises; the other contains solutions to the exercises.

Finally, all supporting software has been updated to Python 3 (but most of it runs unmodified in Python 2).

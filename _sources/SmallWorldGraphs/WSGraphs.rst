   Figure 5.2: WS graphs with :math:`n=20`, :math:`k=4`, and :math:`p=0` (left), :math:`p=0.2` (middle), and :math:`p=1` (right).

To make a **Watts-Strogatz** (**WS**) **graph**, we start with a ring lattice and “rewire” some of the edges. In their paper, Watts and Strogatz consider the edges in a particular order and rewire each one with probability :math:`p`. If an edge is rewired, they leave the first node unchanged and choose the second node at random. They don’t allow self loops or multiple edges; that is, you can’t have a edge from a node to itself, and you can’t have more than one edge between the same two nodes.

Here is an implementation of this process.

::

    def rewire(G, p):
    nodes = set(G)
    for u, v in G.edges():
        if flip(p):
            choices = nodes - {u} - set(G[u])
            new_v = np.random.choice(list(choices))
            G.remove_edge(u, v)
            G.add_edge(u, new_v)

The parameter ``p`` is the probability of rewiring an edge. The for loop enumerates the edges and uses ``flip`` (defined below) to choose which ones get rewired.

::

    def flip(p): 
        return np.random.random() < p

``flip`` uses a module from NumPy (which is imported as np in this example) named ``random``. This module has a method also named ``random``, which returns a number between 0 and 1.

``flip`` returns ``True`` when the random number is less than the given probability ``p``, it returns false when the random number is greater than or equal to ``p``.

If we are rewiring an edge from node ``u`` to node ``v``, we have to choose a replacement for ``v``, called ``new_v``.

1. To compute the possible choices, we start with ``nodes``, which is a set, and subtract off u and its neighbors, which avoids self loops and multiple edges.
2. To choose ``new_v``, we use the NumPy function ``choice``, which is in the module random.
3. Then we remove the existing edge from ``u`` to ``v``, and
4. Add a new edge from ``u`` to ``new_v``.

As an aside, the expression ``G[u]`` returns a dictionary that contains the neighbors of ``u`` as keys. It is usually faster than using ``G.neighbors``.

This function does not consider the edges in the order specified by Watts and Strogatz, but that doesn’t seem to affect the results.

:ref:`Figure 5.2 <SWG_FIG_2>` shows WS graphs with :math:`n=20`, :math:`k=4`, and a range of values of p. When :math:`p=0`, the graph is a ring lattice. When :math:`p=1`, it is completely random. As we’ll see, the interesting things happen in between.

.. mchoice:: question_4.5.1
   :answer_a: The graph becomes more like a lattice.
   :answer_b: The graph becomes more consistent.
   :answer_c: No rewiring happens.
   :answer_d: The graph becomes more random.
   :correct: d
   :feedback_d: Correct!
   :feedback_b: Look again of what happens as p goes higher.
   :feedback_c: p is the probability that something is rewired.
   :feedback_a: Look again at the picture on the right where p is at its highest.

   As demonstrated in figure 4.2, what happens as p increases?

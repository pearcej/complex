Introduction
------------
In the previous chapter we saw an example of a system with a critical point and we explored one of the common properties of critical systems, fractal geometry.

In this chapter, we explore two other properties of critical systems: heavy-tailed distributions, which we saw in :ref:`Section 5.5 <5.5>` and pink noise, which I’ll explain in this chapter.

These properties are interesting in part because they appear frequently in nature; that is, many natural systems produce fractal-like geometry, heavy-tailed distributions, and pink noise.

This observation raises a natural question: why do so many natural systems have properties of critical systems? A possible answer is **self-organized criticality** (SOC), which is the tendency of some systems to evolve toward, and stay in, a critical state.

In this chapter I’ll present a **sand pile model** that was the first system shown to exhibit SOC.

The code for this chapter is in chap10.ipynb_ in the repository for this book. More information about working with the code is in :ref:`Section 1.4 <1.4>`.

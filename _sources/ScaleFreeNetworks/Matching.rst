.. dragndrop:: M_5
    :match_1: Barabási-Albert Model|||Algorithm for generating random scale-free networks using a preferential attachment mechanism.
    :match_2: Heavy-tailed Distributions|||A probability theory with probability distributions whose tails are not exponentially bounded.
    :match_3: Standard Deviation|||Used to indicate the extent of deviation for a group as a whole.
    :match_4: Power Law|||A distribution follows this law if :math:`PMF(k) ∼ k−α` where ``PMF(k)`` is the fraction of nodes with degree ``k``, ``α`` is a parameter, and the symbol ∼ indicates that the ``PMF`` is asymptotic to ``k−α`` as ``k`` increases.
    :match_5: Preferential Attachment|||A quantity of something is distributed according to how much already exsisting recipients have.
    :match_6: Scale-Free Network|||A network whose degree distribution follows a power law, at least asymptotically.
    :match_7: Cumulative Distribution Function|||Maps a value to the fraction of values less thank or equal to x.
    :match_8: Complementary CDF|||:math:`CCDF(x) ≡ 1 - CDF(x)`
    :match_9: Explanatory Models|||A model that gives a useful description of why and how a phenomenon is the way it is.
    :match_10: WS Model|||Has characteristics of a small world network, like the data, but it has low variability in the number of neighbors from node to node, unlike the data.
    :match_11: Probability Mass Function (PmF)|||A function that maps from each value to it's probabilities.
    :match_12: Growth|||Instead of starting with a fixed number of vertices, the BA model starts with a small graph and adds vertices one at a time.

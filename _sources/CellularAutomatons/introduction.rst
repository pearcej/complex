Introduction
------------

A **cellular automaton (CA)** is a model of a world with very simple physics. “Cellular” means that the world is divided into discrete chunks, called cells. An “automaton” is a machine that performs computations — it could be a real machine, but more often the “machine” is a mathematical abstraction or a computer simulation.
This chapter presents experiments Stephen Wolfram performed in the 1980s, showing that some cellular automatons display surprisingly complicated behavior, including the ability to perform arbitrary computations.
I discuss implications of these results, and at the end of the chapter I suggest methods for implementing CAs efficiently in Python.
The code for this chapter is in chap06.ipynb_ in the repository for this book. More information about working with the code is in Section :ref:`Section 1.4 <1.4>`.

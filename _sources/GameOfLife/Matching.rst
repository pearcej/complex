   :match_2: Instrumentalism|||View that theories are instruments that we use for our purpose.
   :match_3: Beehive|||A stable pattern in which every cell in the beehive has 2 or 3 neighbors, so they all survive, and none of the dead cells adjacent to the beehive has 3 neighbors, so no new cells are born.
   :match_4: Glider|||Is back in the starting position, shifted one unit down and to the right, after a period of 4 steps.
   :match_5: Unstable Pattern|||Pattern that changes from generation to generation.
   :match_6: Toad|||These patterns change over time but eventually return to their initial configuration. It oscillates between two states.
   :match_7: Spaceship|||Some patterns oscillate and return to the starting configuration, but shifted in space.
   :match_8: Puffer Train|||leaves live cells in its wake as it is a translating pattern.
   :match_9: Stable Pattern|||Pattern that does not change from generation to generation.
   :match_10: Gosper's Gun|||The number of live cells grows indefinitely as a stable pattern that periodically produces a spaceship — as the stream of spaceships moves out from the source.
   :match_11: Methuselahs|||Long-lived patterns that yield a surprising number of live cells.
